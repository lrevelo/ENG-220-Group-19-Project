### Project Title: Air Quality / Methane / CO‚ÇÇ

---

## üìò Project Abstract
Climate change has become one of the most pressing issues for recent generations and will continue to be for future generations. CO‚ÇÇ is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gases.  
We have chosen a dataset that shows the density of CO‚ÇÇ emissions of each country from 1750‚Äì2022. This allows us to identify the largest contributors and analyze their causes.  
Our goal is to help reduce the carbon footprint of large contributors. By cleaning the data using MATLAB, we will identify the best solutions to give to these countries such as expanding public transportation, enforcing climate-friendly regulations, and switching to clean energy.  
Our expected outcome is to have an easily accessible place to view each individual country‚Äôs carbon footprint and outline potential solutions for the largest contributors.
